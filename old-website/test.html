            <h2> Analyzing the Conspiracy & Political Corpuses</h2>
            <p> &emsp;&emsp;As long as there is a government, people will question the powers that
                be. With the immergence of the Internet, people questioning the government and its
                antics is now fairly common. Any one can now access documents that (allegedly)
                reveal all of big brother's darkest secrets through online forums and databases.</p>
            <p><i>TextFiles.com</i> is one website that has archived hundred, possibly thousands of
                text files, some of which are related to conspiracy theories and political files.
                Funnily enough, both categories are questioned for their reliablity and
                trustworthiness. So, I figured it might be interesting to compare the two. Before I
                started analyzing the corpuses, I hypothesized that the conspiracy texts would be
                scattered in relevance to their topics and be written informally. While the
                political texts would written professionally, and be related to national matters
                inside the United States.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, due to errors, I could not examine each and every single text using
                Voyant. So, I chose 23 text files each from both categories. The results seemed to
                prove my hypothesis.</p>

                <p> &emsp;&emsp;The most notable difference between the two corpuses is the
                    difference in vocabulary. Looking at the conspiracies, the words vary, relating
                    to some kind of government corruption. Most of the texts are directly
                    referencing the United State's government and its international relations with
                    geopolitical entities, like Africa and New Zealand. The CIA seems to be the
                    prime suspect in most of the conspiracies, but this is understandable since the
                    Agency is known to handle foreign matters. (Fig 1.)</p>
                <p> &emsp;&emsp;Regardless of some questionable theories in regards to the CIA; it
                    is a real-world entity that has power in political affairs. In the political
                    corpus, the CIA is mentioned several times for operating with no respect of
                    ethics. Beyond the CIA and foreign-related matters, the corpus seems more
                    related to national occurances. (Fig 2.)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p> &emsp;Comparing the two corpuses reveal American culture and its relation with
                    governmental corruption. Governmental assignments lke MK-Ultra and Operation
                    Condor portray an image of a machiavellian entity willing to use and abuse its
                    citizens. Conspiracies related to the United States' governments are not ideas
                    made up from baseless assumptions, but are allegations that are backed up by
                    real-world events. Still, a majority of conspiracies lack any real evidence that
                    back up their claims. This brings into question the competency of the texts
                    themselves.</p>

                <p> &emsp; The political corpus has 4647 unique word than the conspiracy corpus. It
                    is hard to say that the number of unique words is related to the complexity to
                    the content or is simply the result of having more words in general. For the
                    benefit of the doubt, it is likely the latter </p>
                <p> &emsp; What is rather noticable difference between the two corpuses is the
                    Readability Index. Though the difference is minor, the political documents have
                    more readable text compared to the conspiracies. The consistency of readability
                    seems not as variable either.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p> &emsp;Of course, government documents are written to be understood by most
                    people who read them, so consistent writing and good readability is expected.
                    You can apply that logic to the conspiracy files, but thats ignoring their
                    origin and purpose. By nature, conspiracy theories are biased and informal,
                    especially compared to governmental texts. Most of the conspiracy files from
                        <i>TextFiles.com</i> are written by online denizens or partisan
                    organizations. Some texts are equivelent to word salad, on par to the writings
                    of a schizophrenic. </p>

                <p> &emsp; Launching up AntConc and looking at the ngrams of each reveal the same results. Most combination of words or phrases are references to geopolitical entities, locations, or people. However, some phrases stand out, such as; "members of the" and "prisoners of war". Increasing the N-Gram size seems to yield the same results.</p>

            <h2> Conclusion</h2>
            <p> &emsp;The conspiracy and political file from TextFiles.com differed like I predicted. With the conspiracy files going over a variety of different political topics and interests, while the political files are in reference to national affairs. It is a facinating group of texts to explore. Like I mentioned before, a majority of the files could not be analyzed due to errors with the software. There is still a lot left unexplored. Big thanks to TextFiles.com for providing an awesome array of files to look at! You can access the website at the top of website, in the navigation bar.</p>
