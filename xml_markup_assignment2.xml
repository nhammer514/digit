        <chunk type="verse" num="1">Bad town burn down outta sight New rent get spent, no wrong or
            right Roll around the blue lights You could see melting ice Neighbors found 'em leaking
            out the other night Coulda hit him when he tried to write Pig billy club or the lead
            pipe Grow out in the east, learned to eat and fight Read and sight death stares that
            keep me up at night</chunk>

        <chunk type="chorus" num="1">Tryna roll away New space, new blade, it’s the same thing
            Happen like it did out in Rockaway I still say, when I hit the grave Sailors moving on
            his next wage The next blade cut deep Metallic taste, metallic ways, getting beat back
            in the day But shit has changed, type pentagrade instead of graves They got me thinking
            'bout my next wage</chunk>

        <chunk type="verse" num="2">And I’m leaning with the blade again Stuck losing friends, buck
            teeth sinking in My dad said, "Shit is bad, don’t get better than shit's been" He prolly
            right, bet it keep him up at night Covered in the ash, I hopped a green board I cut both
            hands and they still sore From rolling through this mosh pit too hard Arms and the body
            parts coming out the top floor</chunk>

        <chunk type="chorus" num="2">I'm tryna roll away New space, new blade, it’s the same thing
            Happen like it did out in Rockaway Still say, when I hit the grave Sailors moving on his
            next wage The next blade cut deep Metallic taste, metallic ways, getting beat back in
            the day But shit has changed, type pentagrade instead of graves They got me thinking
            'bout my next wage</chunk>

        <chunk type="outro" num="1">Sirens shining in, it's so inspiring (Cut deep) They got me
            thinking 'bout my next wage Sirens shining in, it's so inspiring They knife sharpening
            (Cut deep) Sirens shining in, it's so inspiring (Cut deep) Got me thinking 'bout my next
            wage It's so inspiring, the knives sharpening The sirens shining in</chunk>
