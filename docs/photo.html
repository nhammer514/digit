			    <p><img src="images/photos/IMG_9948.JPG" class="portrait"/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past month has been quite a journey for me, spiritually and mentally. In fact, this past week has the dawn of a new beginning as I develop as a person. I have learned new aspects of my reality; how I perceive my relations, the desire for appreciation, and patience. Let me not dismiss the facts, I got to where I am now not through happiness and dreams, but insecurity and submissiveness.  With summer coming to an end, a season of my life is ending. </p><br/><br/><br/>
			    <p><img src="images/photos/IMG_9924.JPG" class="portrait2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More often than not, people show up in my life, then disappear without any satisfying or pleasant conclusion. Out of these situations, I usually learn something, whether it’s about myself or others around me. I will forever be thankful to the souls who were a part of my life, despite how much hurt they made me go through. Unconditional love is such a powerful feeling. It is one of the realest emotions a human could feel I think, but rarely is it reciprocal. </p><br/><br/><br/>
			    <p><img src="images/photos/IMG_9929.JPG" class="portrait"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult not to indulge in the emotions that drag you down. In some way, the motions of depression and anxiety provide a sense of toxic security. The subliminal sense of “If nothing in life existed, everything would be better.” This is called l’appel du vide, or “the call of the void.” It can appear in a variety of different ways; the impulse to drop everything, the obsession over what could’ve been instead of accepting what is, to lose faith in the physical world. </p><br/><br/><br/>
			    <p><img src="images/photos/IMG_9938.JPG" class="portrait2"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often times these intrusive thoughts will lead to negative thought patterns that cause you to hurt yourself more than to heal. But then you realize the futility of the void. That in the end of it all, it is the final destination for all things physical. Then, once you realize the nature of physical reality, the love and appreciation for it becomes even greater. This appreciation gets to the point where not only is your physical reality heightened, but your subjective reality as well. </p><br/><br/><br/>
			    <p><img src="images/photos/IMG_9936.JPG" class="portrait"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is never perfect, but that is its objective reality. Life was never meant to be perfect, is simply meant to be lived and experienced. Even through life’s struggles, there is this inherited beauty that, no matter what, everything will be okay. I was unable to do the proposal I said I would do for this assignment, because of some fairly reasonable excuses, but also some extremely invalid ones as well. </p>
