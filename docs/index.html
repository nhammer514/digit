                <p> Hello! I am Nathan Hammer, and welcome to my webpage. Here, you can find the
                    projects I have worked (or working) on and my resume. This website is still in
                    development, so some features/elements may or may not work. The website is using
                    Javascript, so make sure that is enabled-- or something. Regardless, welcome to
                        <i>nhammer.online! :)</i></p>
                <p> Even when I was young, I found great interest in computers and the arts. I
                    encountered many incredible creations made by random, Internet denizens. These
                    creations have inspired me to create my own corner of the Internet, and publish
                    my stuff for the world to see!</p>
