            <h2> Caves of Qud Review </h2>
			<hr>
			<h3> Overview </h3>
			<p>&emsp;Welcome to the <i class="highlight">Caves of Qud</i>; a rogue-like, adventure sandbox game where you create your own character and set off on your own bat-s***, insane journey. 
			In the <i class="highlight">Caves of Qud</i>, you can do whatever your heart desires; have conversations with the trees, cut off your limbs, grow new limbs, anger an entire faction of apes, throw nuclear grenades at said apes, talk to the trees some more, and so on...
			Though your journey may be your own, rarely is in your control. Death is an inevitable reality in the <i class="highlight">Caves of Qud</i>. You will die, and you will die often.</p> 
			<h3> Gameplay </h3>
			<p> &emsp;The reason why you die so often is probably because of the game's RNG (random number generator) system. Nearly every aspect of the game is randomly generated, with the exception of special locations and items. Each time you start a new save (which will happen often), 
			you will encounter new characters, cultures, historical events, diseases, spells, weapons, and more. Even the treatment plans for diseases are randomly generated. Because the game is so unpredictable, it is best to design a character that is adaptable to the unknown.</p>

			<p> &emsp;When starting a new save, you will be prompted to create your character. For your character, you will have to pick inbetween two races; be a mutated human or be true-kin. As a mutated human, you are a walking limb generator. Everytime you level up in the game, your genome will randomly mutate. Starting at level one as a mutated human, you will probably look like your average human; two arms, two legs, a head, etc. However, by level ten, calling your character a "person" would be a gross understatement. The new limbs you could grow may be multiple heads, crab pinchers, scorpion stingers, psychic powers, the ability to regrow limbs, the ability to f***ing fly -- As a mutated human, the sky's the limit, with the exception of whatever can kill you. That is why, for new players, I recommend starting as a mutated human. Once you get well aquainted with the game, and lose your save because you died to assault rifle-weilding Barathrumites (bears), you can get into being true-kin. As true-kin, life gets a little harder. You are not as strong as a mutated human, you cannot gain crazy abilities, and above all else; your limbs are temporary. If you amputate your right arm because of a fungal infection, you are not growing it back. However, as a true-kin, you can buy cybernetic replacements and become something equivalent to the Terminator. Robotic limbs ain't free though. you will need to earn money before you can do that. You can make income by either selling items that you find laying around in abandoned villages, or by doing quests assigned by special NPCs.</p>
			<p> &emsp;Admittely, <i class="highlight">Caves of Qud</i> is a VERY difficult game, and there is still a lot of aspects I need to personally explore. It demands you to know all the intricite features of the game and use them all for your advantage. From what I have heard, pushing the game to its limits, and breaking it is the best way to be successful. <i class="highlight">Caves of Qud</i>'s turn-based gameplay is very reminecent of classic retrogames like ROGUE and Dwarf Fortress, which has very much inspired its visual aesthetic.</p>
			<h3> Aesthetic/Style </h3>
			<p>  The Caves of Qud's visual aesthetic is inspired by classic ASCII art, but with a retro-futuristic twist that gives the game a unique visual appeal. The pixelated graphics are beautifully crafted with a limited color palette, featuring a wide range of detailed character sprites, environments, and effects.</p>

			<h3> Plot </h3>
			<p>&emsp;From what I have seen, there is some semblance of a plot in the <i class="highlight">Caves of Qud</i>, but it is all overshadowed by the mind-boggling and absurd generation you encounter. To put it bluntly, everything in the game feels like the manifested ravings of a paranoid schizophrenic. Plants talk to you, people with robot arms cast spells, technologically-advanced arachnids carry 21st century weaponry, monkey royalty enforces tariffs and start monkey riots, etc.</p>
			<p>Is there a plot? Maybe. In my opinion, the plot is whatever you encounter.</p>
